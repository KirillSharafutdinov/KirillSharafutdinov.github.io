                <h3>1. What Data Do We "Collect" and How Do We Use It?</h3>

                <p><strong>No Personal Data Collection</strong>: We DO NOT COLLECT or REQUIRE any personal information from you.</p>
                <p><strong>Local Camera Data Processing</strong>: Images/videos are processed exclusively on the device, and are not saved or transmitted.</p>
                <p><strong>Recognized Text</strong>: Recognized text is stored temporarily in the device's RAM only for the duration of the Text Reader and Text Search functions, and is immediately deleted when these functions are terminated.</p>
                <p><strong>Text Search Manual Input History</strong>: Stored locally on the device (UserDefaults). You can clear it at any time in the application's Settings Menu.</p>
                <p><strong>Item Search Results</strong>: Stored temporarily in RAM and deleted immediately after the frame is processed and notifications about the search results are sent to the user.</p>                
                <p><strong>Voice Recognition (Used in all input functions)</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The application uses iOS system capabilities for speech recognition and Siri integration (Speech framework, App Intents framework) with an explicit instruction to use on-device processing.</li>
                    <li>The audio recording of your voice is NOT saved by our application.</li>
                    <li>The recognition result is used immediately, stored in RAM for a few seconds and deleted immediately after use.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                
                <p><strong>Important clarification</strong>: Although our app requires and uses only local speech recognition on the device, Apple's Speech framework may, in accordance with its own policies and iOS system warnings, send some speech data to Apple to process requests and improve its services. This potential data transfer is initiated and controlled solely by the iOS operating system and Apple services, and not by our app. Our app does not receive, store or have access to any raw audio data or recognition results that may be processed outside of your device by Apple system services. We only use the final recognition result (text/command) provided by the system and only locally on your device.</p>
                <p><strong>Speech Synthesis Data</strong>: The generated audio stream is not stored.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>2. Data Storage</h3>
                <p>The only data stored is the manual input history for "Text Search" and user preferences. All other data is processed temporarily in RAM and immediately deleted.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>3. Security</h3>
                <p>Security is ensured by local processing and iOS security mechanisms. Camera/microphone access is requested explicitly.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>4. Your Privacy Rights</h3>
                <p><strong>Control over History</strong>: Manage and delete your input history via the app.</p>
                <p>For temporary data (RAM), rights are implemented automatically (data is not saved).</p>
                <p><strong>Processing Restriction</strong>: Deny access to the camera/microphone via iOS settings.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>5. Important Contextual Privacy Warning</h3>
                <p>Text synthesized speech through the speaker may be heard by others. Be careful with sensitive content.</p>
                <p>Heed the iOS system warning: When requesting access to the microphone, iOS may inform you that speech data through Apple system services may be sent to Apple for processing and improving their technologies. This potential transfer occurs at the level of the Apple operating system and services, as described in Section 1.</p>
